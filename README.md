# Dykstra's Map

Currently a single static map with two static points of interest are used to test a matrix based version of Dykstra's Algorythm. The distance to every traverable point from each of the points of interest is added together and an array of the points from which the shortest round trip to both destinations can be made and the distance traveled is returned.

## TO-DO

- build map dynamically
- choose points of interest dynamically
- return the constructed and retreived data in a GUI
- animate the distance aquisition process
- animate the final path
